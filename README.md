# App: When Should You Refinance?

## Team Members: Joseph, Justin, Kip, Scott, Sean

## Project Description/Outline: 
Idea is to create an app that allows user interaction in which the user provides their information related to refinancing a mortgage (location, credit score, amount, years remaining, etc), and the output is a calendar showing likely rates that would be offered over the next X number of weeks, along with actionable "This is the likely week you should re-finance". Behind the scenes, the app uses machine learning to predict what interest rate the user would be offered based on their answers to the app's questions.
