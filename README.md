### Background
Notes FTA [Basics of commodities trading](https://www.thebalance.com/trading-crude-oil-futures-809351): 

Notes FTA [Crude oil classifications](https://www.thebalance.com/the-basics-of-crude-oil-classification-1182570):
* Many types of crude oil
* Naming is mix of location ("West Texas...") and/or characteristics  (sweet, sour, light, heavy)
* * Sweet and Sour
* * * Crude oil with low sulfur content is classified as “sweet.” 
* * * Crude oil with a higher sulfur content is classified as “sour.” 
* * * Sulfur content is considered an undesirable characteristic for both processing and end-product quality. 
Therefore, **sweet crude is typically more desirable and valuable than sour crude**. 
* * * West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is a good example of sweet crude oil, while oil from Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast tends to be sour.

Crude oil futures have a few classifications:
**Light Sweet Crude Oil** is the most popular grade of crude oil being traded because it 
is the easiest to distill into other products and it is traded 
on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). 

* **Brent Blend Crude** is a grade of oil that is primarily traded in 
London and seeing increased interest. Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United 
States are the world's three largest oil producers as of 2018.
**Brent is the most widely used benchmark for determining gasoline prices.**
