## Working idea - analysis on current crude oil crash

### Background
Notes FTA [Basics of commodities trading](https://www.thebalance.com/trading-crude-oil-futures-809351): 

Crude oil futures have a few classifications:
**Light Sweet Crude Oil** is the most popular grade of crude oil being traded because it 
is the easiest to distill into other products and it is traded 
on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). 

* **Brent Blend Crude** is a grade of oil that is primarily traded in 
London and seeing increased interest. Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United 
States are the world's three largest oil producers as of 2018.
**Brent is the most widely used benchmark for determining gasoline prices.**
